# S3

#### Security

You can store data on S3 with either/both client side encryption and server-side encryption.

#### Event Notifications

The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration identifying the events you want Amazon S3 to publish, and the destinations where you want S3 to send the event notifications.

Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:

* SNS
* SQS
* Lambda

**To use Event Notifications:**

1. Create the queue, topic or Lambda function (target)
2. Grant S3 permission to publish to the target/invoke the lambda function. For SNS/SQS, this is done by appling an appropriate polcy to the topic/queue. For Lambda, you must create and supply an IAM role, then associate it with the Lambda function.
3. Arrange for your application to be invoked in repsonse to activity on the target
4. Set the Bucket's Notification Configuration to point to the target
