# API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway provides throttling at multiple leves invluding global and by a service call. Throttling limits can be set for standard rates and bursts. For example, API owners can set a rate limit of 1,000 requests per second for a specific method in their REST APIs, and also configure Amazon API Gateway to handle a burst of 2,000 requests per second for a few seconds.

Amazon API Gateway tracks the number of requests per second. Any requests over the limit will receive a 429 HTTP response (Too many requests). The client SDKs generated by Amazon API Gateway retry calls automatically when met with this response.
